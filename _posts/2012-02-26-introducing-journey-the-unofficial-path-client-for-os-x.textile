<p class="meta">26 Feb 2012 - Singapore</p>

<p>As previously <a href="http://mclov.in/2012/02/08/path-uploads-your-entire-address-book-to-their-servers.html">mentioned</a>, we wanted to make an unofficial Path client for OS X, which unfortunately created an Internet <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/120207/p43#a120207p43">ragestorm</a>. Putting distractions aside, we got to work during our second Anideo hackathon and after spending approximately 48 hours in total (this was a side project), we are happy to announce that <a href="http://journeyformac.com">Journey</a>, the unofficial Path Reader for OS X is available for <a href="https://github.com/downloads/JourneyForMac/Journey/Journey%200.1.0.dmg">download</a>. The code is also available under an MIT license on <a href="http://github.com/JourneyForMac/Journey">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>As much as we love <a href="http://path.com">Path</a>, the rationale behind open-sourcing Journey is that we felt we couldn't commit enough man-hours to ensure the continued quality of the project, so we are experimenting with making Journey a community-driven Mac application.</p>

<h3>Back Story</h3>

<p>This project was the result of the cumulative efforts of <a href="http://twitter.com/raingrove">Peter</a> (who runs <a href="http://decisivebits.com">Decisive Bits</a> - an HTML5/iOS/Android consultancy based in Singapore), <a href="http://twitter.com/ntluan">Kent</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ajhit406">AJ</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/iamclovin">myself</a> (who all work on <a href="http://getdenso.com">Denso</a> as part of our day jobs). We spent two all-nighters, a few sessions of pair-programming (sometimes even over iChat) and plenty of Red Bull and coffee.</p>

<p>We wanted the first version to be simple, since as <a href="http://facebook.com/zuck">Brother Mark</a> says, "Stay Focused & Keep Shipping". Hence we agreed very early on that the first version would be a "read-only" Path client, i.e. you can only read status updates and view pictures, but wouldn't be able to post anything to Path. With that out of the way, we spent the first few hours discussing architecture, and decided that we'd use web views (with HTML/CSS and Javascript) to power the views and ASIHTTPRequest as the HTTP client.</p>

<p>We also decided to test drive as much of the code as possible, and so we used Peter's awesome <a href="http://github.com/petejkim/Specta">Specta</a> and <a href="http://github.com/petejkim/Expecta">Expecta</a> libraries to do so. Kent and I were quite new to TDD on Cocoa, so pair-programming with Pete definitely helped to get us on track.</p>

<p>We used the wonderful <a href="http://glyphicons">glyphicons</a> library for all the icons on the app, and hand-coded all the HTML and CSS, to make it look as close as possible to the Path iOS app.</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>

<p>There are some features missing (even for a reader), but this is our MVP and depending on the feedback that we receive from users, we'd like to work on it more. Even better, submit an issue and a pull request, and we'll gladly merge your changes!</p>

<p>We had a lot of fun making this app, and we want to continue building and shipping good software, and we hope this is just one in a series of many high-quality apps.</p>
