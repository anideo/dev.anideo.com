title: How we setup Amazon Cloudfront to play nice with Rails 3.0.x on Heroku

<p>As was mentioned in our <a href="http://dev.anideo.com/2011/12/30/how-moving-to-amazon-cloudfront-increased-our-app-store.html">previous post</a>, we recently started using Amazon Cloudfront for our CDN needs. We wanted the performance benefits that we would gain from the move, we certainly didn&#8217;t want it to come at the cost of speed of deployment.</p>

<p>While the CloudFront custom origin server solution takes care of deployment, there is still the problem of expiring stale assets (especially Javascript and CSS).</p>

<p>As they say, the two toughest problems in Computer Science are caching, naming things and off-by-one errors.</p>

<p><strong>Asset Fingerprinting</strong></p>

<p>The problem of expiring stale content for CDN&#8217;s (and browsers) is solved by <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#what-is-fingerprinting-and-why-should-i-care">asset fingerprinting</a> as part of Rails 3.1&#8217;s Asset Pipelining feature.</p>

<p>Every file in the app/assets directory in Rails 3.1 is &#8220;compiled&#8221; as part of the <code>rake assets:precompile</code> Rake task and the asset fingerprint is appended to the each file&#8217;s path and copied over to public/. The asset fingerprint is an MD5 digest of the contents of each file - so if a file is changed (for e.g. and image is changed or you change something in your CSS), the MD5 of the asset will change, and hence that particular asset will be &#8216;expired&#8217;.</p>

<p>The blog post that I referenced from the <a href="http://blog.opengovernment.org/2011/02/10/cloudfront-s3-rails-and-jammit-on-apache/">Open Government</a>, uses the SHA of the most recent Git commit as the asset fingerprint. While that is a simple solution, it is quite inefficient. Think about it - any time you make a change to your site - (including model code or a change in a Rake task), your assets will be expired, even though technically the assets haven&#8217;t changed.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t change our CSS/JS/images that often, but we do make changes to our business logic quite often (and deploy multiple times a day), so this solution won&#8217;t fly and defeats the purpose of the CDN, since content will always be expired.</p>

<p><strong>Asset Fingerprinting without Sprockets</strong></p>

<p>What we came up with is a better solution, which takes a digest of the entire public/ directory under Rails.root. It&#8217;s still less efficient than Sprockets&#8217; asset fingerprinting, since in our solution the fingerprint is a hash of the entire directory and not each file. So even if you make a change to a single file, an unrelated file under the public/ will also be expired even if it hasn&#8217;t changed.</p>

<p>The hash of the public/ directory is stored in a file called <strong>assets.fingerprint</strong> under Rails.root, and is generated like <a href="https://gist.github.com/1554094">this</a>.</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/1554094.js?file=set_asset_fingerprint.rb"></script></p>

<p>This is a function of a deploy Rake task which performs pre-flight checks such as these before pushing to Heroku.</p>

<p>We define a constant called REVISION which is defined in <code>config/initializers/asset_fingerprint.rb</code> thusly:</p>

<p><code>REVISION = File.read(Rails.root.join(&#8216;assets.fingerprint&#8217;)).strip</code></p>

<p>&#8230;and in application.rb, the assets path is prepended with the hash as part of the path.</p>

<p>We also make sure that we use Rack::Rewrite to rewrite paths to the assets to ignore the hash and that the assets host points to the Amazon CDN.</p>

<p>Our entire application.rb is here for your reference: <a href="https://gist.github.com/1554090"><a href="https://gist.github.com/1554090">https://gist.github.com/1554090</a></a>.</p>
